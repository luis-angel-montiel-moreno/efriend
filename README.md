Efriend-MAIC :: a logical-based Artificial Intelligent Agent System Chat-bot for Well-being Mental Health.

REMARKS
---
1. This is a prototype research project we are not responsible for the consequences of the use of efriend-MAIC by private or public instances. 
2. The software was originally written in Spanish language, it will be translated to English language soon.
3. This software is still evolving. In future time there will be updates for improving it.
4. The main purpose of this software is to contribute with conceptual Design & Architecture of a logical-based Artificial Intelligent Agent System Chat-bot: i.e. to describe formally the structure of a framework to develop this kind of Agents.
This framework is independent of the domain of the application (in this case the domain is 'Well-being Mental Health'.
5. The micro-dialogue tasks are written in Spanish some of them based on mild therapies ('Mindfulness', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Finding the Element', 'Flow States') for presenting enriching talks. Although the micro script slave agent tasks are based in experts resources, the aim of the project is to show a concept proof prototype where the framework can be applied to an specific domain filled by authorized experts.
6. Any copy-rights of text in micro-dialogues tasks corresponds to their correspondent authors.
7. MAIC means 'Master Agent Artificial Intelligent Composer' however you could pronounce it as 'Mike' or 'Mickey' (it is not a mouse).
8. Frequently documentation will be increased and updated .
9. **Strong Remark.** Although the presented framework is domain independent. Every purpose presented in this work is subject to the maximal meta objective: Support Human Development to be Integral, Equanimous and Compassionate. The same for any project inherited or inherent from this one in direct or indirect way.

RUNNING Efriend-MAIC-console
---

In bash console-terminal run the following commands: 

Only for the first session.
```
make reset
make pipe_line_quantitative
sh reset.sh
```

For running a session quantitative version (presented in submitted research paper to [TPLP](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming)):

```
sh pipe_line_quantitative.sh
```

**Note.** E-friend MAIC proposes-computes-composes a different consecutive session each time you run `sh pipe_line_quantitative.sh` until all the sessions are finished. If you want to reset and start from the first session please run the command `sh reset.sh`
